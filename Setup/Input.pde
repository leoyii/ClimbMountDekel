// Though many things were designed to work in a straight forward manner in Processing, 
// reading primitive types and Strings from the keyboard was not one of them. Because 
// of the graphical nature of Processing it was designed to have interaction mainly 
// using the mouse (which Processing makes fairly easy). It is also fairly easy to get 
// individual keystrokes from the keyboard; However, to read ints, floats, Strings, etc. 
// we will need some help. This file is that help.
//
// Open up a new blank Processing document. Go to "Sketch -> Add File..." and then choose
// the file Input.pde. There will now be 2 tabs in you new sketch with Input.pde being 
// visible. Select the *other* tab and you can type in your program there. In order to use
// the code from Input.pde in your program you will need to use the functions/methods in: 
// void setup(); void draw(); or, any other method you create.
